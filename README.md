# Porch Bench

## Materials
I suggest using a weather-resistant wood like white oak or cedar if the bench is going to be outside. The legs are made from 8/4 (1.5" x 1.5") while the rest of the parts are 4/4 (3/4"). If you are buying S4S lumber, the seat trim is 1x3 and the rest is 1x2. Because most of the exposed wood is edge grain, you can get away with cheaper grades of lumber. I made mine from 2C grade lumber and laid out around the imperfections in the wood.

## Dimensioning Lumber

The slats can be a challenge to get a good fit. If any of them is slightly longer or shorter, the gaps will be obvious. I cut all the parts slightly long by 1/64" or so. I chose one to be the reference and dimensioned it as accurately as possible. Then I used a marking knife to mark each of the other parts to the same length and used the shooting board again to trim each down to the knife mark.

The seat trim dimension are to the outside corner of the miter. Again, I suggest cutting slightly long and trimming to fit during assembly (more on this later).

The legs have a taper that starts just below the shelf. I use a taper/jointer jig on my table saw. If you don't have one, you can build one a simple jig from plywood. There are many Youtube videos on making tapering jigs.

I used a 1/8" roundover on all parts except the seat trim, where I went with 1/4".

## Joinery

The legs and the rails are joined with 3/8" dowels, 2 dowels per joint arranged vertically. I went with a 1/8" reveal on the rails (meaning the dowel holes are spaced an extra 1/8" in from the edge on the legs).

The shelf slats and side slats are also attached with dowels. You can use 1/4" dowels for these joints as they aren't going to be stressed as much as the rail joints. I also used 2 dowels per joint to make sure that the slats don't twist if the glue joints fail or soften up.

The seat rails have a 3/4" dado pattern to accomodate the seat slats. To ensure accuracy, I used double-sided tape to hold the two seat rails together while I cut the dados. This ensures that the rails will be parallel, which is important for a good fit when you attach the seat trim.

## Assembly

As mentioned earlier, the slats can be challenging to get a good fit, so be sure to do a dry fit on everything before you start your glue-up.

I started by assembling the two leg/rail assemblies. The sheer number of dowels can make assembly a bit nerve-wracking. First, I glued the dowels into the rails for both the legs and the side slats. Then I attached the slats and the legs to the rails and clamped the assembly together. If you've cut your pieces accurately, the assembly should be square due to the number of dowels.

The second step is to assemble the shelf slats. Again, glue all the dowels in place first. If you're using 1.5" length dowels, you'll need to trim about 3/8" off the outermost upper dowels so that they don't interfere with the dowels in the leg joint. Now, attach all the shelf slats. Check the shelf to leg joints for square, preferably using a right-angle clamp to keep them square until the glue sets.

The next step is to attach the seat slats. I suggest choosing one end of the bench as the reference and make sure that all the slats stick out by the same distance and are square to the seat rail. If you do that, it won't matter if the other side is slightly out of square, the seat trim will cover up any minor problems. However, if the slats themselves aren't square, you're going to find it difficult to close the miters on the seat trim and/or close the gaps on the slats.

Finally, it's time for the seat trim. I cut a miter on one end of a short and long seat trim piece and then clamp them into position. Mark the inside corner of the unmitered end of the short piece and then cut the miter. I then work my way around, cutting a miter, clamping the piece in place, checking fit, etc. until I'm finally down to one last short piece. Cutting this piece will require removing the long pieces one at a time. I always cut slightly long and trim until it fits. A miter shooting board helps a lot to close the corners and get a good fit.

## Finish

My bench sits outside, so I elected for a simple pure Tung Oil finish. I recommend avoiding a film finish if the piece will be exposed to UV.

It can be easier to apply the finish before assembly. Just make sure to mask off any areas where glue will be applied.
